# Meal Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a **Meal Management System** designed to streamline operations for dining facilities like hostels, college messes, or shared living arrangements. It aims to efficiently manage users, daily menus, meal attendance, expenses, and financial settlements.

Developed using **C++** for the application logic and user interface, and **MySQL** as the relational database management system, this project focuses on robust data management and a clear, functional user experience.

## Features (Planned)

The following key features are planned for implementation:

### Core Functionality

* **Monthly Meal Period Setup:**
    * Define and manage monthly meal periods, setting up the framework for each month's operations.
* **User Management:**
    * Secure user registration and login.
    * Different user roles (e.g., Student, Staff, Admin) with appropriate permissions.
    * Ability to view and update user profiles.
* **Menu Management (Admin/Staff):**
    * Add, edit, and delete individual menu items (e.g., "Rice", "Chicken Curry").
    * Set daily menus, assigning specific menu items to Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner for each day.
    * View historical and upcoming daily menus.
* **Expense Tracking (Shopping Management):**
    * Record all shopping expenses, including date, item purchased, price, and who paid for it.
    * Categorize expenses for better analysis.
* **Meal Consumption Tracking (Attendance):**
    * Record user attendance for specific meals on a given date.
    * Generate daily meal lists showing who consumed how many meals.
* **Information Editing & Settings:**
    * Ability to edit any previously entered information (e.g., user details, menu items, expenses).
    * Manage system-wide settings, including currency.
* **Financial Analysis & Settlement:**
    * Calculate monthly bills based on meal consumption and shared expenses.
    * Analyze individual user's financial status, showing their total contributions, total expenses, and resulting debt or surplus.
    * Record and track payments made by users.
    * Generate comprehensive financial reports.

### Technical Aspects

* **Database:** MySQL for structured data storage and retrieval.
* **Programming Language:** C++ for the application logic.
* **Database Connectivity:** MySQL Connector/C++ to enable seamless communication between the C++ application and the MySQL database.
* **User Interface:** Initially a console-based application, with potential for a simple graphical user interface (GUI) later if feasible within the project scope.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for database operations and user input.
